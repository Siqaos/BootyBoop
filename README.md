# BootyBoop
Discord bot using discord py rewrite
Made for my cousin to be always the first.
# How to use :
You need to modify `bot.py` to add the token and `headless.py` to modify the URL.

this bot only serves one use case.

Either just launch the program with `python bot.py`or use docker build . to build an image and start the container using `docker run`.
