# BootyBoop
Discord bot using discord py rewrite<\br>
Made for my cousin to be always the first.<\br>
# How to use :
You need to modify `bot.py` to add the token and `headless.py` to modify the URL<\br>
this bot only serves one use case.<\br>
Either just launch the program with `python bot.py`<\br>
or use docker build . to build an image and start the container using `docker run -it -d <image-id> python bot.py`<\br>
You can also just download the image with `docker pull siqaos/bootyboop`<\br>
Thank you for your interest.<\br>
